File Encryption Software Python and .json
Command-line application that provides user authentication and file encryption/decryption functionality
Encrypted passwords with login threat detection and automatic incident lockout system
Implemented a dual encryption system supporting both Fernet and AES encryption methods. The AES encryption is manually managed, incorporating HMAC for data integrity checks to detect any corruption. Additionally, user-specific password-based encryption is employed, enhancing individual data security.
